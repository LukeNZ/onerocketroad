One Rocket Road has three special custom-markdown rules to enable richer content:

Images can be embedded in the following way: `![caption](image-link "Attribution" left|right|wide)`, where `caption` is what appears when you hover over the image, `image-link` is a local URL to the image resource,
`attribution` is what appears immediately beneath an image, and one of `left|right|wide` defines the placement of the image within the document.

Videos from YouTube (only) can also be embedded: `@[caption](video-link)`, where `caption` is what appears beneath the video, and `video-link` is a full YouTube **embed** URL. 
A direct video link will not suffice.

Tweets from Twitter can also be placed within the page: `#[caption](tweet-link)`, where `caption` is what appears beneath the video, and `tweet-link` is a direct link to a tweet. A profile or image link
will not work.
